math - built-in library that provides access to common math functions and constants

numpy - fundamental package for scientific computing, contains n-dimentional arrays and matricies with high-level math functions to operate on aforementioned arrays 

tensorflow - symbolic math library for dataflow and differentiable programming, used for machine learning/neural networks

keras - minimalist library for developing deep learning models

warnings - non-fatal alerts

matplotlib - plotting library that provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications

matplotlib.pyplot - collection of command style functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB

pandas - data analysis and manipulation tool

PIL - aka Pillow, the python imaging library

requests - HTTP library

io - deals with various types of I/O, three main types (text, binary, raw)

sklearn.model_selection - 

scikit-learn - machine learning 

sklearn.model_selection train_test_split - splits arrays or matricies into random train and test subjects

io BytesIO - expects bytes-like objects and produces bytes objects

PIL Image - provides a class with the same name which is used to represent a PIL image

os - miscellaneous operating system interfaces, allows you to interface with the underlying os (Windows, Mac, or Linux)

random - generates pseudo-random numbers

keras applications - provides model definitions and pre-trained weights for popular architechures (VGG16, ResNet50, etc.)

keras Model - function API, given some input tensor(s) and output tensor(s), you can instantiate a model that will include all layers

keras.models Sequential - linear stack of layers

keras.layers - flattened list of layers comprising the model

keras.layers Dropout - a technique used to prevent a model from overfitting, works bu randomly setting the outgoing edges of hidden units (neurons that make up hidden layers) to 0 at each update of the training phase

keras.layers Flatten - reshapes the tensor to have the shape that is equal to the number of elements contained in tensor not including the batch dimension, in other words, it flattens the iput and does not affect batch size

keras.layers Dense - applies weights to all nodes from the previous layer

keras.layers BatchNormalization - normalizes the layer inputs on a per-feature basis

keras.utils.np_utils - numpy related utilities

keras.utils.np_utils to_categorical - used to convert class vector to binary class matrix

glob - finds path names matching a specified pattern, able to manipulate directories and sub-directories
